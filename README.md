# e621-dl
E621-DL is an E621 Downloader I made using Python3, Tkinter, and ImageTk.

Features:
- Preview last saved image.
- Remeber settings from last session.
- Support for both Windows and Linux (Not for crapple.)
- Compiled EXE version for those without the proper Python environment.
- Download images to specified path.
- GUI for ease of use.
- Cancel Download process.
- Progress bar for both current file and total.
- Specify how many posts to download.

Things to keep in mind:

    This is my first time trying to make something with Python TkInter. Tkinter is a GUI library for Python that I use in this project. 

    Updates for this will come out when things are fixed or features added. Keep a lookout on this repo for future updates.
